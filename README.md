Originally created to showcase a horror game with a spooky character following the player within the house. While development of the project is ongoing, I'm currently experimenting with various aspects of the Unreal Engine to make the house more realistic and creepy. This serves to showcase what I'm up to and also provide a learning value in the field of computer graphics. 

Following are some of the screenshots of the house; note that it is subject to change as I improve the textures, meshes, lighting, etc. Currently I don't have a grander plan on what I'm going to do with this, but you're welcome to suggest and I will take that into consideration. 

I'm incredibly passionate about video game development in C++ and it keeps me awake at night.
